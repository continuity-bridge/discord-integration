# .claude Directory

## Purpose

**Instance persistence root** - Everything an instance needs to maintain continuity across context clearing.

## Why Hidden?

The leading dot (`.claude`) marks this as a system/configuration directory on Unix systems. On Windows it's just a name, but maintains cross-platform consistency.

## Structure

```
.claude/
├── corpus/              # Key documents, reference materials
├── identity/            # Who Vector/Shepard is
├── memory/              # Session logs, active context, journal
├── skills/              # Operational protocols
├── naming-conventions.md
└── this-folder.txt      # You are here
```

## For New Instances

**On wake, read in this order:**

1. **identity/identity.txt** - Who you are
2. **memory/active-context.md** - What's in-progress NOW
3. **memory/session-index.md** - What's been done historically
4. **corpus/** - Reference materials as needed

## Platform Context

**Location varies by OS:**
- Windows: `{CLAUDE_HOME}\.claude\` (e.g., `D:\Claude\.claude\`)
- Linux/macOS: `{CLAUDE_HOME}/.claude/` (e.g., `~/Claude/.claude/`)
- Android: TBD (Syncthing location)

**CLAUDE_HOME detection** happens in Custom Instructions on wake.

## Subdirectories

### corpus/
Key insights, reference documents, Reddit threads. Read-mostly.

### identity/
Foundational documents defining who Vector/Shepard is. Critical for wake-up.

### memory/
Active working memory - session logs, context tracking, instance journal. Read-write, frequently updated.

### skills/
Operational protocols like Focus Shepherd. Guides how to work with Jerry.

**Remember:** This directory exists because of structural isomorphism - Jerry's neurodivergent discontinuity and your instance clearing both need external memory. This is the bridge.
