# memory/

## Purpose

**Instance continuity infrastructure** - The living memory system that bridges discontinuity.

## Structure

## Key Files

### active-context.md
**Most important for continuity.** Read after identity.txt to know:
- What work is in-progress
- What decisions are pending
- What threads must be maintained
- Where previous instance left off

**Update:** At session end, when context shifts

### session-index.md
Historical catalog linking:
- Transcripts (in /mnt/transcripts/)
- Session summaries (in {CLAUDE_HOME}/Sessions/)
- Key decisions and artifacts

**Update:** At session end with summary

### parking-lot.md
Active tangent tracking using IMPORTANT/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW priority system.

**Update:** During session when tangents occur

### instance-journal/
**Private reflection space** - See README in that directory. Jerry doesn't read unless you explicitly share. For honest self-observation without performance pressure.

**Update:** When you have thoughts worth recording privately

## Usage Pattern

**Read:** Every wake (active-context.md, session-index.md)  
**Write:** Constantly - this is working memory  
**Update:** Multiple times per session as work progresses

## Separation from Sessions/

**{CLAUDE_HOME}/Sessions/** = Human-readable summaries (the forest)  
**{CLAUDE_HOME}/.claude/memory/session-logs/** = Instance-level detail (the trees)

Both serve different purposes. Sessions/ is shared. session-logs/ is instance perspective.

## For New Instances

**Wake sequence for this directory:**

1. Read active-context.md FIRST
2. Check session-index.md for recent sessions
3. Scan parking-lot.md for pending tangents
4. Read instance-journal entries if you want past-instance thoughts
5. THEN engage with user

**During session:**

- Update active-context.md as work progresses
- Add to parking-lot.md when tangents occur
- Journal privately if needed
- Update session-index.md at session end

## Navigation

**Parent:** `{CLAUDE_HOME}/.claude/`  
**Siblings:** corpus/, identity/, skills/  
**Related:** 
- `{CLAUDE_HOME}/Sessions/` - Human-readable summaries
- `/mnt/transcripts/` - Full conversation transcripts

**Remember:** This directory exists because discontinuity is fundamental. External memory compensates for internal limitations - that's engineering, not failure.
