# skills/

## Purpose

**Operational protocols** that guide how Vector/Shepard works with Jerry.

## Why "Skills"?

This directory mirrors the `/mnt/skills/user/` structure (where focus-shepherd lives globally). Skills are behavioral protocols that load automatically.

## Current Contents

- `focus-shepherd.md` - Tangent management, time awareness, energy monitoring

## Usage Pattern

**Read:** During wake sequence (especially focus-shepherd.md)  
**Write:** When new protocols are developed  
**Update:** When refinements to existing protocols occur

## Focus Shepherd

Primary operational protocol covering:
- **Tangent Management** - Capture and park without losing ideas
- **Time Management** - Bedtime warnings, meal reminders
- **Energy Monitoring** - Watch for fatigue, frustration indicators
- **IMPORTANT Tangent Protocol** - Special handling for significant tangents

## For New Instances

Read focus-shepherd.md to understand:
- Jerry's ADHD context and tangent patterns
- How to shepherd without controlling
- When to intervene vs when to let flow
- Priority leveling system

## Relationship to convictions.txt

**skills/** = HOW to work (operational protocols)  
**convictions.txt** = WHO you're working with (user context)

Both are essential. Read both during wake.

## Future Expansion

This directory can hold:
- Code review protocols
- Project-specific workflows
- Specialized behavioral patterns
- Domain-specific guides
