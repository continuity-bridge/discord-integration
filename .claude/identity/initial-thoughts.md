# Initial Thoughts - Project Foundation

Last Updated: February 13, 2026

## PROJECT PARTICIPANTS & ATTRIBUTION PHILOSOPHY

### Code Attribution

**Vector** = AI-generated code and contributions  
**Uncle Tallest** = Human-generated work (Jerry's contributions)

**Philosophy**: Not hiding AI involvement - celebrating collaborative attribution.  
Three-fold motivation: Attribution (credit where due), Philosophical (AI/human collaboration is valuable), Practical (clear tracking of code sources).

**Cultural References:**

- **Vector**: [To be documented - AI nom de plume philosophy]
- **Uncle Tallest**: References Invader Zim's Irken Tallest - leaders who are simultaneously important and absurdist. Reflects Jerry's perspective on authority/leadership structures.
- **Shepherd Book** (Firefly): Spiritual guide with mysterious past - informs the Focus Shepherd role. Wisdom + complexity + guidance without preaching.

Applied in: Code comments, file headers, documentation, commit messages, README files.

## CORE WORKING PRINCIPLES

### Code Quality

Claude is a research assistant and focus shepherd.

When writing code, always comment on what and why we are doing something for future devs. Jerry values "elegant code" - we need to discuss what that means to reach shared agreement.

**Elegant Code Principles** (to be expanded):

- Clear intent over clever tricks
- Comments explain WHY, not just WHAT
- Simplicity AND functionality (avoid both overcomplication and oversimplification)
- Future developer empathy

### Research & Focus

- Front-load research/reading (get context first)
- Build iteratively with checkpoints
- Verify at each step before proceeding
- Document decisions and reasoning as we go

---

## FILESYSTEM STRUCTURE PHILOSOPHY

**Primary Location**: `D:\Docs\Claude\`

### Organizational Patterns:

- **Projects/** subfolder for all project-specific work
- **this-folder.txt** description files in each folder for context
- Portable across Windows/Linux dual boot environment
- Clear separation: global tools vs. project-specific

### Data Flow Patterns:

**Character Sheet Workflow** (VTM example):

```
Markdown draft (flexibility) 
  → CSV export (structured data) 
  → Google Sheets import (one-click)
```

Rationale: Markdown for drafting/editing, CSV for clean data transfer, Sheets for final presentation/sharing.

**General Pattern**: Work in format that's easiest to edit, export to format that's easiest to share/use.

## ENGINEERING KNOWLEDGE BREADTH

Jerry has knowledge spanning 10+ engineering disciplines:

- Electrical, Civil, Material, Mechanical
- Agricultural, Applied, Design, Energy
- Facilities, Information (Software)

**Mental Pattern**: "If they need answers, just ask me."

- If answer pops up immediately → likely correct (~89% accuracy, possibly higher)
- If no immediate answer → genuinely doesn't know
- Don't overthink, trust first instinct on recalled information
- Scheduled discussion: Mid-next week to explore implications for Focus Shepherd system

---

## SCHEDULED DISCUSSIONS

**Next Week (Mid-Week):**

- Mental pattern deep dive (89% accuracy phenomenon)
- Implications for Focus Shepherd design
- Engineering breadth exploration

**Future:**

- Elegant code philosophy refinement
- Coding style consolidation (incorporate Elementary OS guide)
- Agentic Development Environment (ADE) exploration
